//! The busbar plugin CONTRACTS — the crate every plugin builds against, and nothing more.
//!
//! The engine (`busbar`) consumes plugins; plugins implement engine contracts. Both therefore
//! depend on this small, dependency-light crate, which holds exactly the shared surface:
//!
//! - **auth** — the [`AuthModule`] trait and its verdict types ([`AuthOutcome`], [`Principal`]),
//!   plus the constant-time credential primitives every module compares with.
//! - **hooks** — the [`RoutingPolicy`] trait (decide/transform/notify + configure/describe) and
//!   the read-only projections it is invoked with.
//!
//! Everything here is a CONTRACT, not machinery: no I/O, no engine state, no transport. A
//! third-party plugin crate that depends only on `busbar-api` is architecturally identical to a
//! built-in one.
