# Changelog

All notable changes to Busbar are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.14.0]

### Added
- **Cohere v2 protocol** (`/v2/chat`) — the 6th wire protocol (Reader + Writer,
  request/response/streaming, bearer auth). System prompts are canonicalized into
  the IR so they survive cross-protocol translation.
- **Azure OpenAI auth adapter** — a per-provider `auth: api-key` style that sends
  the `api-key` header instead of bearer (deployment + `?api-version=` ride the
  existing `path` override). No new dependency; same `sign_request` seam as Bedrock
  SigV4. Template shipped in `providers.yaml`.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — the protocols-not-providers thesis and auth-adapter design.

### Fixed
- Cross-protocol pool responses now preserve the upstream `model` field (added to
  the IR), matching direct routes — a pool landing on a cross-protocol member no
  longer returns a model-less body.
- Token accounting on the buffered cross-protocol (non-streaming) path: usage is
  now tapped and charged to the virtual key, so TPM limits enforce (previously
  per-key tokens stayed 0).
- `max_requests` lifetime cap is now enforced — the success path records the lane
  success and decrements the budget (`spend_budget` previously never decremented),
  and the per-lane `ok` counter increments on success (was always 0; also fixed a
  latent double-count in `record_success`).

### Notes
- This changelog was previously stale; entries before 0.14.0 are not yet
  backfilled (tracked for the 1.0 documentation pass).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffolding for open-source release: `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`,
  `SECURITY`, issue/PR templates, and CI workflow.

### Changed
- Licensed the project under **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (previously MIT) — the AGPL's
  network-use clause is the appropriate copyleft for a gateway run as a service.

### Notes
- Pre-1.0: the current binary is an Anthropic-format gateway with named/ad-hoc
  routing, round-robin pools, and a circuit breaker. See the roadmap for the path
  to native multi-protocol support, weighted distribution, and cross-protocol
  failover.
